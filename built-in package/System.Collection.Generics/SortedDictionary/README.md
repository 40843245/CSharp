# some CH skipped
Since `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>` and `SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>` has lots of same API (methods, property), even though their implementation is NOT different.

I skip these operations about `SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>`, it can be seen at the link in [demo project in `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`](https://github.com/40843245/CSharp/blob/main/built-in%20package/System.Collection.Generics/Dictionary/demo%20project.md)
